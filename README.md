Created loopbuild.sh , meganbuild.inp, and StoreSplitDNA.sh

* StoreSplitDNA.sh - script to split each DNA strand made in directories of desired DNA mutations
* meganbuild.inp - basic build template to paramaterize each DNA strand made
* loopbuild.sh - apply the template "meganbuild.inp" to each of the strands made from StoreSplitDNA.sh
